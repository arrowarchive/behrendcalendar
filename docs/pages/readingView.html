               <p class="note"> This is one of the most bizarre calendar pages out of the collection. It's one of,
                  if not, the only page that doesn't have a drawing or photo on it. I wonder if she
                  couldn't think of anything to draw. Maybe she didn't have time, or maybe this quote
                  inspired her. Who knows?—#rgerzevske</p>

               <p class="note"> This is a stark contrast from the previous page; it was somber, likely from losing
                  someone close, and now she's drawn something silly about rabbits, a common "game"
                  animal. Maybe she knew someone who was hunter, since rabbit are common game animals
                  when they are not being kept as pets.—#rgerzevske</p>
