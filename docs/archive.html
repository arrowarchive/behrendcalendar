        <p>This will be where the calendar pages are stored. I have a few placeholder images in place for now, and this is set up similar to how my own art portfolio's gallery is set up, but this is subject to change.</p>
            <p>If every calendar page is available, then it means that all of them will have to load at once. This will be taxing on the RAM, so maybe I can use a format like this, but have a box with a clickable dropdown that will only show the pages for a certain month when clicked. I've thought of doing that for my own website, but I don't know how to do that yet. </p>
            <p>Additionally, I need to talk more with my own group members before adding to the website. It's why the home page is so bare bones and why the history page is incomplete. I hope I can meet with them soon though!</p>
